# 🎮 Connect Four AI Game — Python + Pygame + Minimax + Alpha-Beta Pruning

Welcome to a classic **Connect Four** game reimagined with **artificial intelligence**. Built entirely in **Python** using **Pygame**, this project brings together game development and intelligent decision-making through **Minimax Algorithm** and **Alpha-Beta Pruning**.

---

## 🌟 Project Overview

This project is a modern implementation of the beloved **Connect Four** board game, where the player competes against an **intelligent computer opponent**. The AI doesn't just make random moves — it thinks, calculates, and plays strategically using game theory principles.

Whether you're a **Python developer**, an **AI enthusiast**, or someone learning **game algorithms**, this project is built to teach, engage, and inspire.

## 🧠 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Logic

The AI is driven by:

- ✅ **Minimax Algorithm** – Recursively simulates all possible future game moves to select the optimal strategy
- ✅ **Alpha-Beta Pruning** – Greatly improves performance by skipping unnecessary paths in the decision tree
- ✅ **Heuristic Evaluation Function** – Rates the board state to predict future success

Together, these create a challenging yet beatable opponent.
